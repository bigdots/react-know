# 组件的更新

React 提供了俩个方法用于组件的更新。

## setState

```js
/**
 * Sets a subset of the state. Always use this to mutate
 * state. You should treat `this.state` as immutable.
 *
 * There is no guarantee that `this.state` will be immediately updated, so
 * accessing `this.state` after calling this method may return the old value.
 *
 * There is no guarantee that calls to `setState` will run synchronously,
 * as they may eventually be batched together.  You can provide an optional
 * callback that will be executed when the call to setState is actually
 * completed.
 *
 * When a function is provided to setState, it will be called at some point in
 * the future (not synchronously). It will be called with the up to date
 * component arguments (state, props, context). These values can be different
 * from this.* because your function may be called after receiveProps but before
 * shouldComponentUpdate, and this new state, props, and context will not yet be
 * assigned to this.
 *
 * @param {object|function} partialState Next partial state or function to
 *        produce next partial state to be merged with current state.
 * @param {?function} callback Called after state is updated.
 * @final
 * @protected
 */
ReactComponent.prototype.setState = function(partialState, callback) {
    this.updater.enqueueSetState(this, partialState);
    if (callback) {
        this.updater.enqueueCallback(this, callback, "setState");
    }
};

/**
 * Forces an update. This should only be invoked when it is known with
 * certainty that we are **not** in a DOM transaction.
 *
 * You may want to call this when you know that some deeper aspect of the
 * component's state has changed but `setState` was not called.
 *
 * This will not invoke `shouldComponentUpdate`, but it will invoke
 * `componentWillUpdate` and `componentDidUpdate`.
 *
 * @param {?function} callback Called after update is complete.
 * @final
 * @protected
 */
ReactComponent.prototype.forceUpdate = function(callback) {
    this.updater.enqueueForceUpdate(this);
    if (callback) {
        this.updater.enqueueCallback(this, callback, "forceUpdate");
    }
};
```

```js
  /**
   * Sets a subset of the state. This only exists because _pendingState is
   * internal. This provides a merging strategy that is not available to deep
   * properties which is confusing. TODO: Expose pendingState or don't use it
   * during the merge.
   *
   * @param {ReactClass} publicInstance The instance that should rerender.
   * @param {object} partialState Next partial state to be merged with state.
   * @internal
   */
  enqueueSetState: function(publicInstance, partialState) {

    // 从ReactInstanceMap取出{publicInstance: this}
    var internalInstance = getInternalInstanceReadyForUpdate(
      publicInstance,
      'setState',
    );

    // internalInstance为null直接返回
    if (!internalInstance) {
      return;
    }

    // 如果实例的_pendingStateQueue为空,则创建它
    var queue =
      internalInstance._pendingStateQueue ||
      (internalInstance._pendingStateQueue = []);

    //将partialState放入_pendingStateQueue
    queue.push(partialState);

    // 调用ReactUpdates.enqueueUpdate();
    enqueueUpdate(internalInstance);
  }
```

enqueueUpdate包含了React避免重复render的逻辑


故getInitialState，componentWillMount， render，componentWillUpdate 中setState都不会引起updateComponent。但在componentDidMount和componentDidUpdate中则会。
